        <h3> What is <i>Quests</i> ? </h3>
        <p> Quests is a web application that allows users to enhance their productivity by gamifying the journey to achieving their various goals. </p>

        <!-- how does it work -->
        <h3> How Does It Work? </h3>
        <p> Users will enter their goals into their proper categories. Based on the category selected, users will either set small, actionable tasks or a daily habit to make it easier to achieve their general goals. </p>
        <p> Once these smaller tasks are achieved, users earn points or XP towards a collectible or leveling-up.

        <!-- information about the inspiration -->
        <h3> Information about the Inspiration  </h3>
        <p> My role as a student in highschool inspired to develop this website. As juniors in highschool, my peers and I have many academic commitments that we must keep track of. </p>
        <p> In addition to these commitments, we have extracurricular activities and other personal development goals (physical health, religious obligations, family responsibilities, etc.) </p>
        <p> To streamline the process of managing multiple goals of different types, while also gamifying the experience to make it enjoyable, I decided to create Quests. </p>
